## go-collection

**go-collection** is a Go library that provides a comprehensive abstraction layer for common data structures, allowing developers to leverage these structures easily and efficiently. This package is designed to simplify the implementation and use of fundamental data structures like:

- **Doubly Linked-List**: A sequence of elements where each element points to both its previous and next element, enabling efficient traversal in both directions.
- **Stack**: A *Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)* structure ideal for scenarios like function call management or backtracking algorithms.
- **Queue**: A *First-In-First-Out (FIFO)* structure commonly used in task scheduling or breadth-first search algorithms.
- **Heap**: A binary tree-based structure where the parent node is always smaller (min-heap) or larger (max-heap) than its children, useful for priority queues.
- **Set**: A collection of unique elements, providing fast lookups and ensuring no duplicates.

### Key Features

- **Abstraction**: Easily interact with data structures without worrying about the underlying implementation.
- **Efficiency**: Each structure is optimized for its typical use cases, ensuring performant operations for insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
- **Flexibility**: The package offers a variety of methods to manipulate data structures, making it suitable for different types of projects (algorithms, games, web services, etc.).
- **Ease of Use**: The intuitive API allows developers to quickly implement and use data structures without needing to build them from scratch.
